  Changes:
    - Fix for player -> character rename in 0.17.35

Date: 30. 03. 2018
  Changes:
    - Stacking/unstacking activities are no longer included in production statistics.
    - This can't be a retroactive change so you will still see beltbox production stats in the past.

    - Beltboxes now base their crafting speed on the speed of their corresponding belts, instead of assuming integer multiples of vanilla speeds.
    - Hand-unstacking recipes now appear at the bottom of the same crafting tab as their corresponding base item (if not hidden by mod settings) instead of defaulting to Intermediate Products.

Date: 17. 02. 2018

Version: 1.3.0

    - An easy way for modders to make their items stackable has been provided. See the readme pdf inside the zip.
    - Tier 4 and 5 beltbox technologies are available if Bob's Logistics is active. The research costs are whack because Bob's Logistics costs are whack.

    - Uranium ore/235/238 and batteries added to research tier 3.
    - Iron sticks and sulfur added to research tier 2.
    - Green and red circuits moved from tier 3 to tier 2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 31. 01. 2018
  Changes:
    - Beltboxes now stack 5 items instead of 4. For reasons.
    - Belt compression has therefore increased to 5x, but inventory density stays the same.
    - Logs, iron ore, copper ore, stone, and coal can now be stacked at tier 1, solid fuel at tier 2.
    - Stacked items inherit fuel values. Supercoal, hayo.
    - Stacked icons/sprites can be generated automatically from base items if no FPS-saving custom sprite exists (mainly for future mod support).
    - Stacking recipes hidden from the player crafting menu (but not from filters).
    - Migration: technology check.
    - Item and recipe init deferred, to try and catch stack size changes from other mods.
    - Stacked item stack sizes are rounded down if another mod is caught changing vanilla stacks to a non-multiple of 5.
    - ReStack added as an optional dependency because it insists on making very late changes to vanilla items.
